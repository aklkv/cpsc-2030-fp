## Project Overview

Your team was hired to develop a robust and easy to use content management system (CMS). The company has three main departments: HR, sales, and helpdesk.

Employees from each department should not have access and/or given authorization to modify other department's pages (e.g. HR staff could not modify articles/pages published by sales).

Users should be able to view all the articles/pages published by the different department. All they need to do is go to the company's home page.
